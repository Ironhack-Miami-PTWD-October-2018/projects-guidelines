Introduction
------------
Let's start with something fun for your first project - **a game!**

It's important to make your game exciting and _juicy_! For more information about making your game _juicy_, [see the lesson about it on the platform](http://learn.ironhack.com/#/learning_unit/6689).

You and the Ironhack staff will also vote for your favorites and award three medals: Bronze ðŸ¥‰, Silver ðŸ¥ˆ, and Gold ðŸ¥‡.

Here are some examples of past projects:
- [Kitty Clicker](https://ryanjso.github.io/PhKitty/index.html)
- [Paper Droid](https://alexvirdee.github.io/paper-droid/)
- [Manny-Ski](https://anaraballo.github.io/MannySki-game/)
- [Oprah Game](https://jonathanlsanch.github.io/Oprah-Run/)
- [Changing Keys](https://dougdejong.github.io/game-changing-keys/)
- [Galactic Wars](https://bartosian.github.io/)
- [The Interview](https://rachel-hofer.github.io/Ironhack-Project1-TheInterview/)


Schedule
--------
## Full-time:
- **Stand ups***
- **Coding Kata**
- **Project development**

## Part-time:
- **Week Nights**
    - **Stand ups***
    - **Project development**

- **Saturdays**
    - **Stand ups***
    - **Coding Kata**
    - **Project development**
<br>

**Every day, during project weeks, you will start with this activity. Take a minute to update your colleagues with your progress: what did you do so far, do you feel on the track, behind or ahead, what's your plan for today and do you think you'll have any blockers.*


### For both: two days before presentation day ###

_Presentation Practice_: About You & Your Project + Demo. Refer to the [Presentation Section](#presentations) to see how to create your presentation. <br>
   
   
### Presentation day ###
Finally, it's time for your real presentation. You will present your projects to the staff and other students. Remember to dress at least one degree nicer than normal. [See Demo Tips](#demo-tips)

<!-- ### Monday - December 10th ###
- **Stand ups** -->

<!-- ### Wednesday - December 12th ###
- **Stand ups** -->

<!-- ### Saturday - December 15th ###
- **Stand ups**
- **Coding Kata** 
- **4 PM** - _Presentation Practice #1_: About You & Your Project <br>
  For your first presentation practice
  you should create your initial presentation structure. <br>
  [See Presentation Section](#presentations) -->

<!-- ### Monday - December 17th ###
- **Stand ups** 
- **7 PM** - _Presentation Practice #2_: Demo <br>
  For the second presentation practice
  you should incorporate a demo of your live app at the end of your talk.

  but you should make adjustments based on feedback from the previous practice. <br>
  [See Demo Tips](#demo-tips) -->


<!-- ### Wednesday - December 19th ###

Updated Technical Requirements
------------------------------
Your app must:

1. **Render a game in the browser**.
2. **Have logic for winning and/or losing**
   and show feedback to the player in either case.
3. Include **separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript**.
4. Use **plain JavaScript or jQuery** for DOM manipulation
   (or HTML canvas for graphics).
5. **Have a repo on GitHub**.
6. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
7. **Be deployed online** using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
8. Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.



Updated Deliverables
--------------------
- A **working game, built by you** that runs in the browser.
- A **deploy of your game** in GitHub Pages.
- The URL of the **GitHub repository** for your game.
- The URL of the **live game on the Internet**.
- The URL of the **slides for your game's presentation**.
- You must present your game during Project #1 final presentations (last day of Project #1 time).


Presentations
-------------
For each of the 3 projects you make at Ironhack, you will also have to make a presentation about it. Communication (including public speaking) is an important skill to practice for finding a job after Ironhack.

### Format ###
- Talking with Slides: **3 minutes**
- Demo: **2 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire ###
- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations
  (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  * If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  * If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  * If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications ###
- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**, so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  * [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  * [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)

### Presentation Structure ###
1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **About Me** (1-2 slides):
    * Where are you from?
    * What are some interesting facts about you? (hobbies, travels, etc.)
3. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
    * What is your project?
    * How does it work?
    * Why did you choose it?
4. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
    * How did you overcome that challenge?
5. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
    * What did you learn from it?
6. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
7. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
8. **Total**: 7-11 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes ####
- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.

### Demo Tips ###
1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**. That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs. There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
<!-- 5. If your app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**.
   Otherwise, there will be a delay on the initial load. -->
   
## Project Feedback and Evaluation ##


* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

* **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

* **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Didn't meet expectations_
    **1** | _Met expectations, good job!_
    **2** | _Exceeded expectations, you magnificent creature, you!_

You should use the feedback to focus on what needs to be improved for the next project.

**Good luck!** :heart:
