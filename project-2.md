## Introduction

Now that you are more familiar with the backend, you can make a complete Web application for your 2nd project.
Youâ€™ll be building an **Express** app, which means youâ€™ll learn/practice about what it takes to make a functional application from the ground up yourself.

We suggest that you **do this project in pairs**, but please check in with your teacher.

We hope youâ€™ll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app.

Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your teacher and TAS to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code!

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals â€“ scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Here are some examples of past projects:

- [State of Mine](https://state-of-mine-.herokuapp.com/)
- [Attract-Athletic](https://attract-active.herokuapp.com/)
- [Quick-Fit](https://quickfit-1.herokuapp.com/)
- [Dynamic Warehousing](https://dynamicwarehousing.herokuapp.com/)
- [Divex](http://divex.herokuapp.com/)
- [Hushlink](https://hushlink.herokuapp.com/)

**Every day, during project weeks, you will start with this activity. Take a minute to update your colleagues with your progress: what did you do so far, do you feel on the track, behind or ahead, what's your plan for today and do you think you'll have any blockers.*


### For both: two days before presentation day ###

_Presentation Practice_: About You & Your Project + Demo. Refer to the [Presentation Section](#presentations) to see how to create your presentation. <br>

  For the second presentation practice
  you should incorporate a demo of your live app at the end of your talk.
  Your presentation structure should be more or less the same,
  but you should make adjustments based on feedback from the previous practice. <br>

## Updated Technical Requirements

Your app must:

1. **Use Express** as a foundation.
2. **Use Mongoose** for models and database communication.
3. **Have 2 models _or more_**.
   Having one for users is a no-brainer.
   The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app.
   Don't force it if having more than two models doesn't make sense.
4. **Have validation on its models** with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
5. **Include sign up, log in & log out functionality** with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
6. **Have routes for all of CRUD** for models other than users. There should have created, read, update, and delete features even if they aren't all for the same model.
7. **Have a repo on GitHub**.
8. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
9. **Be deployed online** using Heroku so that anybody could use your app.

Responsive design **is not a requirement, but it's nice to have**.

## Updated Deliverables

- A **working full-stack application, built by you** that runs on a server.
- A **deploy of your app** on Heroku.
- The URL of the **GitHub repository** for your app.
- The URL of the **live app on the Internet**.
- The URL of the **slides for your app's presentation**.
- You must present your app during Project #2 final presentations (last day of Project #2 time).

<!-- Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**. -->

## Presentations

Project #2 presentation will focus mostly on your project. You **won't** have to talk much about yourselves or your background. You should still **introduce yourselves briefly**.

### Format

- Talking with Slides: **3 minutes**
- Demo: **2 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire

- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  - If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  - If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  - If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications

- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**, so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  - [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  - [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  - [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)

### Presentation Structure

1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
   - What is your project?
   - How does it work?
   - Why did you choose it?
3. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
   - What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
   - How did you overcome that challenge?
4. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
   - What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
   - What did you learn from it?
5. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
6. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
7. **Total**: 6-9 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes

- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.

### Demo Tips

1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**. That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs. There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
5. If your app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**. Otherwise, there will be a delay on the initial load.


## Project Feedback and Evaluation ##

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices?

* **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public url using Heroku/some other platform?

* **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Didn't meet expectations_
    **1** | _Met expectations, good job!_
    **2** | _Exceeded expectations, you magnificent creature, you!_

It would be best if you used the feedback to focus on what needs to be improved for the next project.

**Good luck!** :heart:
